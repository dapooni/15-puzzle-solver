# AI-Programming-Project

The program uses the board configuration below as the goal state and lets the user input the initial/start board configuration.

The program output the following for both the IDS and A* Search:
• solution path(corresponds to the moves needed to reach the goal): e.g. [Up-Left-Left-Right]
• solution cost (# of moves in the solution): e.g. 4
• search cost (# of nodes expanded before reaching the goal): e.g. 27
• running time
